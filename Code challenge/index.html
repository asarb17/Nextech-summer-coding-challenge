				<p>
					Air Pollution can be may things, from smog hanging over cities to smoke inside of a home. Air pollution cause about 7 million premature deaths every year due to the diseases it causes. Those diseases are, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections in children. Worldwide air pollution has caused, 29% of all deaths and disease from lung cancer, 17% of all deaths and disease from acute lower respiratory infection, 24% of all deaths from stroke, 25% of all deaths and disease from ischaemic heart disease, and 43% of all deaths and disease from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Air Pollutants with the strongest link to disease are, particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). the health risks due to particulate matter of the less than 10 and 2.5 microns (PM10 and PM 2.5) are the best documented form of air pollution,  PM is capable of penetrating deep into lung passageways and entering the bloodstream causing cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory impacts. In 2013 PM was also classified as a cause of lung cancer. Exposure to ambient air pollution can lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma in both children and adults. Mothers exposed to ambient air pollution can cause adverse birth outcomes, such as low birth weight, preterm birth and small gestational age births. There is also evidence suggesting that ambient air pollution can affect diabetes and neurological development in children. The precise death and disability toll from many of the conditions mentioned are not currently quantified in current estimates because of this, the death toll of air pollution is expected to greatly increase.

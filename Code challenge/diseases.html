					Diseases Casued by Air Pollution
				</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="overview">
				<p>
					Air Pollution is a casue of many possibly fatal disease including, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections in children.
				</p>

				<h2>
					Heart Disease
				</h2>
				<p>
					There are many conditions that come under the category of heart diease.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Blood vessel disease</li>
					<li>Heart rhythm problems</li>
					<li>Heart defects</li>
					<li>Weak heart muscle</li>
					<li>Heart infections</li>
					<li>Valvular heart disease</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					There are many effects of heart disease, they include, 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Heart failure</li>
					<li>Heart attack</li>
					<li>Stroke</li>
					<li>Aneurysm</li>
					<li>Peripheral artery disease</li>
					<li>Sudden cardiac arrest</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					All of these effects can be fatal if not treated.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="stroke">
				<h2>
					Stroke
				</h2>
				<p>
					A stroke is when Blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing cells from getting oxygen or nutrients, the cells will die within minutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are three types of stroke.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ischemic Stroke</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The most common form of stroke</li>
							<li>Ischemic strokes happen when brain blood vessels are narrowed or blocked, this is caused by fat buildup or other debris in blood vessels</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A hemorrhagic stroke is when a blood vessel in th ebrain bursts or leaks.</li>
							<li>Causes</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Uncontrolled blood pressure</li>
								<li>Over treatment with blood thinners</li>
								<li>Buldges at weak spot in blood vessels</li>
								<li>Trauma</li>
								<li>Protein deposits on blood vessel walls that casue them to weaken</li>
								<li>Ischemic stroke leading to hemorrage</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					<li>Transient Ischemic Attack</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Temporary period of symptoms you'd have in a stroke</li>
						<li>Lasts for as little as 5 minutes</li>
						<li>Temporqdecrease in blood supply to the brain</li>
						<li>Blood clot or debris block blood flow to the brain</li>
						<li>Causes an increased risk of full blown stroke later</li>
						<li>Causes an increased risk of full blown stroke later</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>There are multiple effects of strokes.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Paralysis</li>
					<li>Difficulty talking or swallowing</li>
					<li>Memory loss or thinking difficulties</li>
					<li>Emotional problems</li>
					<li>Pain</li>
					<li>Changes in behavior or self care capability</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="COPD">
				<h2>
					Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>COPD is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs</li>
					<li>Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD</li>
					<li>The main cause of COPD in developed countries is tobacco smoking</li>
					<li>In the developing world, COPD often occurs in people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes</li>
					<li>There are two types of COPD</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Emphysema</li>
						<ul>
							<li>a condition in which the alveoli at the end of the smallest air passages (bronchioles) of the lungs are destroyed as a result of damaging exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritating gases and particulate matter</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Chronic Bronchitis</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. It's characterized by daily cough and mucus (sputum) production</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li>Other irritants can cause COPD, including cigar smoke, secondhand smoke, pipe smoke, air pollution, and workplace exposure to dust, smoke or fumes</li>
					<li>Occupational exposure to dusts and chemicals. Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts in the workplace can irritate and inflame your lungs</li>
					<li>Exposure to fumes from burning fuel. In the developing world, people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes are at higher risk of developing COPD</li>
					<li>COPD can cause many issues</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Respiratory infections</li>
						<ul>
							<li>People with COPD are more likely to catch colds, the flu and pneumonia. Any respiratory infection can make it much more difficult to breathe and could cause further damage to lung tissue</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Heart problems</li>
						<ul>
							<li>For reasons that aren't fully understood, COPD can increase your risk of heart disease, including heart attack</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Lung cancer</li>
						<ul>
							<li>People with COPD have a higher risk of developing lung cancer</li>
						</ul>
						<li>High blood pressure in lung arteries</li>
						<ul>
							<li>COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension)</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Depression</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Difficulty breathing can keep you from doing activities that you enjoy. And dealing with serious illness can contribute to the development of depression</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>

			<div class="lungCancer">
				<h2>
					Lung Cancer
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Lung Cnacer is the leading cause of cancer deaths around the world.</li>
					<li>There are two types of lung cancer</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Small cell </li>
						<ul>
							<li>Occurs almost exclusively in heavy smokers and is less common than non-small cell lung cancer</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Non-small cell</li>
						<ul>
							<li>An umbrella term for several types of lung cancers. Non-small cell lung cancers include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li>There are two main casues of lung cancer</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Exposure to radon gas</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Radon is produced by the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water that eventually becomes part of the air you breathe. Unsafe levels of radon can accumulate in any building, including homes</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Exposure to asbestos and other carcinogens</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Workplace exposure to asbestos and other substances known to cause cancer — such as arsenic, chromium and nickel — can increase your risk of developing lung cancer, especially if you're a smoker</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li>There are many adverse effects of lung cancer</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Shortness of breath</li>
						<li>Coughing up blood</li>
						<li>Pain</li>
						<li>Fluid in the chest</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>
					Acute respiratory Infections
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Acute respiratory infections include</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Pneumonia</li>
						<li>Sever pneumonia</li>
						<li>Wheezing</li>
					</ul>
					<li>These are especially dangerous to younger children as it is hard for them to recover from certain diseases in their lungs when they are young.</li>

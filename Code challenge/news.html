					COVID-19 and Air Pollution
				</h2>
				<p>
					As COVID-19 sweeps across the world, new conclusions are being drawn that link air pollution to a higher rate of death due to COVID-19 in areas with high pollution levels. This pollution is caused by but not limited to car exhaust, refineries, and power plants, these things produce particulate matter of 2.5 micrograms which is one of the main causes of many of the diseases listed. Someone who lives for decades in a county with high levels of fine particulate pollution is 8% more likely to die from COVID-19 than someone who lives in a region that has just one unit (one microgram per cubic meter) less of such pollution. Based on this infornation, a clear link can be drawn connecting air pollution to the COVID-19 death rate. While aior pollution has had and effect on COVID-19, COVID-19 has had an effect on air pollution. As stay at home orders were implementd around the world, the world saw a record decrease in air pollution. COVID-19 has casued people to stay at home which means less cars are being used and factories being run, casuing air pollution from these sources to decrease.

					Great Saharan Dust Cloud
				</h2>
				<p>
					As the great Saharan dust cloud cross the Atlantic and it into the US, coming as far north as the Canadian border, links are being drawn from it to air pollution. Approximately 30% of the dust coming from the Sahara is considered to be “fine,” which makes the health impacts much worse, the more concentrated the particles are, the more likely there will be health effects. The particles also pick up all sorts of pollutants, including emissions, soot and exhaust particles, making the dust that’s landing in the U.S. “much more toxic” than what’s actually found in the Sahara. The consequences of breathing in the dust can include everything from sneezing, coughing, difficult breathing to premature death. Dusts clouds from the Sahara are natural phenomenon that happen each year in June and July. It is unkown why 2020's dust cloud is so large.
